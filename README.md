This repository was created during the completion of my postgraduate program, **MSc in Applied Bioinformatics and Data Analysis**, at Democritus University of Thrace. It contains programs written in the C language.


*Infos about final_project.c*

Write a program that reads nucleotide sequences from the standard input and examines them one by one to determine whether they contain a typical procaryotic coding sequence (with a start codon, one of the stop codons at the end of the coding region, and no other stop codons in the intermediate section).
